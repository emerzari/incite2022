# INCITE proposal for 2022

- To compile:

   ./run

- CAUTION:
  
   Please don't commit pdf files.

    NOTE:
    While the templates are all independent (we might combine better if needed) 
    but for now I made just a quick simple reorganization of directories, 
    keeping the format of each template as they were. Not very pretty. 
    But it seems easier to run and debug for compile errors 
    (rather than using Makefile I put).
